# NEXT:
# Heinsberg study gives letality rate of 0.4% (dead/infected). This suggests people without symptoms are relatively numerous. Check if their progression needs better modelling - pay more attention to the time infectious people need to notice they are infectious, cause that is what a contact tracing app can fix.
# Why is there a change on the 9th of march in the current model? Try to model date changes more in line with actual events, maybe allow for an adjustment period, phasing in infection rate changes.
# How to get the rate infectious/hospitalized in a sensible fashion? That presumably will not be fixed but different from country to country, but still probably about the same for western countries?
# Try to accelerate the generation of exposed (but first check if that is relevant).
# Get the numbers for Austria and run it with that. Similar to Germany, should allow to figure out the coefficient for the lock-down period.
# Then run Italy again, followed by UK
# Try to compare hospital numbers with real stats.
# Compare with healthdata.org
